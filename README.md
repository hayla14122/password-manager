Password Manager is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter that helps users securely store and manage their login credentials for websites and applications. Designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, it provides a clean and interactive interface to add, view, search, and delete account information. Passwords are stored locally in a JSON file and encoded using base64 for basic security, ensuring that sensitive data is not directly exposed.

The application features an easy-to-use table layout to display all saved accounts, with the option to show or hide passwords as needed. Users can quickly search for specific accounts by site or app name, add new credentials, update existing ones, and remove entries with confirmation prompts. The intuitive GUI design makes it accessible for beginners while maintaining the functionality expected from a personal password manager.

Built entirely in Python, this project demonstrates practical usage of file handling, GUI development with Tkinter, data storage with JSON, and basic encryption techniques. It serves as a great learning project for those looking to enhance their Python skills and understand how to manage user data securely in a local application environment.

Future improvements could include implementing stronger encryption with AES, adding a random password generator, introducing GUI themes and icons, and enabling cloud backup for data safety. Overall, Password Manager is a practical, educational, and portfolio-ready project for anyone interested in Python development and basic cybersecurity practices.
